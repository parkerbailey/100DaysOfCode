# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Parker Bailey

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [May 30, Saturday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 
**Today's Progress:** Learned basic git commands and started learning Javascript at https://freecodecamp.org.

**Thoughts:** I learned what concatenate means and what NaN stands for so that's neat. I also learned about camelcase variable names like myVariable or heyDude, string variable contents are immutable, 

**Link to work:** N/A

### R1D2
**Today's Progress:** Learned more javascript as well as learning how to manage user and group permissions on Linux systems with this very simple and concise guide at https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/tools/modify-file-permissions-with-chmod/

**Thoughts:** Today was somewhat slow and hard to focus with everything else going on, but I still got it done.
