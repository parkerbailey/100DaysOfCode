# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Parker Bailey

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 1, Sunday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 
**Today's Progress:** Learned basic git commands and started learning Javascript at https://freecodecamp.org.

**Thoughts:** I learned what concatenate means and what NaN stands for so that's neat. I also learned about camelcase variable names like myVariable or heyDude, string variable contents are immutable, 

### R1D2
**Today's Progress:** Learned more javascript as well as learning how to manage user and group permissions on Linux systems with this very simple and concise guide at https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/tools/modify-file-permissions-with-chmod/. I also did some more HTML/CSS work on my website in preparation for graduation. I also added sandbox.js to the repository to try out things I learn that may not make sense. 

**Thoughts:** Today was somewhat slow and hard to focus with everything else going on, but I still got it done. Ended up procrastinating on some schoolwork to code instead. 

### R1D3
**Today's Progress:** Setup a working RAID-5 NAS on the raspberry pi today and began work on a shell script to track information about the RAID. Also learned how to create symbolic links. 

**Thoughts:** I had no time to be doing this today. I had more important things I should've been doing to be completely honest. I guess that means I'm addicted to coding in a sense? Sometimes my stubbornness overcomes my internal sense of responsibility when it comes to something I'm passionate about. Still trying to decide if that's a good things or not. 

### R1D4
**Today's Progress:** Today I learned a bit more javascipt, finally got past the card game example. Figured out how to run javascript in visual studio code. 

**Thoughts:** I spent far too much time on that card game example for just forgetting a space. It can be somewhat madding how picky the code can be at times. I got stuck on another example too. I still don't totally understand why it has to be bracket notation sometimes instead of dot? Maybe I should just always do bracket to be safe.

### R1D5
**Today's Progress:** Today I learned a bit more bash scripting and wrote a simple backup script. It works well. I added it to a cron job. 

**Thoughts:** Today was a chill day. I was pretty motivated and things were good. Got the backup script done which I've been wanting to do for a while. Now I have things backing up to the 2TB RAID-5 I had set up earlier. It's nice when things just work. 

### R1D6
**Today's Progress:** Added more functionality to the backup script. It can now determine if it is running internally on the server or externally on a client machine. It can also verify if the server is up. 

**Thoughts:** Bash is a really neat scripting language, though somewhat unorthodox in terms of conditional statements and such. I enjoy it's immediate usefulness and functionality. 

### R1D7
**Today's ProgressL** Learned how to setup and run the rsync daemon for file transfers over the network and added in a bit to the backup script for creating backups to the raid over the network automatically. 


**Thoughts:** I'm pretty happy with my backup script. It has a few bugs and can probably be simplified a bit, but the parts that are working are good.
